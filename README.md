# An ML Evaluation Of Chess Pieces
Creating new values for chess pieces at different ELOs and Time Intervals

### Abstract
During a chess game, players commonly refer to chess pieces with a certain numerical value: pawns as 1, bishops & knights as 3, queens as 9, etc. These numbers were created from the start of chess, and have not been changed since. These values are used across all players in order to help articulate how well a player is doing during a certain game. But when we compare players at different levels, we see different patterns with how players utilize their pieces and how they value them. This thesis seeks to focus on analyzing how we can numerically quantify chess pieces, and how these valuations can differ across levels.

From creating proportion data to analyzing the odds of logistic regression, this paper will use these techniques to analyze past games in order to learn how different level players use these pieces and where we see either a difference in value or usage. Through these models, we see patterns that grow and fall across different levels, adding to this hypothesis that the current values we use today are catered towards the best masters in the world rather than the average player. Because of this, this thesis will ideally be the start of creating a new way of learning about chess, from a relatively naive perspective of looking at pieces from more of an individual value, opening up the doors to a dynamic way to improve at any level.
