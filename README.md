# An ML Evaluation Of Chess Pieces
Creating new values for chess pieces at different ELOs and Time Intervals

### Abstract
During a chess game, players commonly refer to chess pieces with a certain numerical value: pawns as 1, bishops & knights as 3, queens as 9, etc. These numbers were created from the start of chess, and have not been changed since, but they have been challeneged. This data analysis report seeks to focus on analyzing how we can numerically quantify these pieces using ML techniques based on past games and how different level players are able to use these pieces to its maximum advantage.
